# Building components manually using [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/)

Please refer to the [developer guide](https://origami.pearsoned.com/docs/developer-guide/building-modules/) for additional information.

## Building and running the example

To run this example, you must first install Gulp globally:

```
npm install -g gulp
```

1. Change into the recipe's root directory: `cd recipes/gulp`
2. Run `npm install && bower install`
3. Run `gulp serve`

To simply build the bundle, run `gulp`. This will generate the output in the `build` directory.
